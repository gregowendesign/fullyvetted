Automatically adds custom taxonomy columns to admin list tables.

== Description ==

This simple plugin is a must-have for anyone that works with custom taxonomies or post types - and is an especially good compliment
to Brad Williams' indispensable [Custom Post Type UI](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/ "Custom Post Type UI") plugin.

By default, WordPress only shows built-in taxonomies in your administrative list tables (e.g. Categories & Tags). But
if you rely on custom taxonomies for organization (particularly when working with custom post types) then you are
typically out of luck.

This plugin fixes that - ensuring that custom taxonomies are added as columns to all necessary list tables automatically.

This is an initial release and includes no bells or whistles - but if you need this functionality, you're likely a developer
just looking for a good head start, anyway. If you have any improvements, additions, or suggestions, please leave a post in the
WordPress.org forums with the correct `custom-taxonomy-columns` tag.
